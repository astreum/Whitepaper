### Nova, Proof of Stake Consensus Mechanism.
- An Epoch lasts One Week.
- The Block Time Target is Three Seconds.
- A Slot is a three seconds period when new Blocks are created.
- Slots are allocated pro rata with Stake every Epoch and removed after Slot Selection.
- A Validator can miss using their Slot when they do not create a new Block or create a malicious Block when selected.
- Slot Selection determines the Validator of the next Block at any time:-
    - Get Addresses with Slot Allocations.
    - Check missed Slots from the last Block to the current time.
    - If no Slots were missed the nearest Address XOR to the last Block hash is selected.
    - If Slots were missed the nearest Address XOR to the Linear-feedback shift register, shifted to the number of slots missed, of the last Block hash is selected.
- The Base Solar Limit is 1,000,000.
- The Base Block Reward is 1 Astr.


### Solar Stability Mechanism
- The Solar price is fixed for every Block.
- The Solar price varies by 0.01%.
- The Solar price increases when more than 90% and decreases when less than 10% of the Solar Limit of the previous Block was used.
- The Base Solar Price is set at 1 Exaquark / 0.000001 Astr.

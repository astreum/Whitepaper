### Nova, Proof of Stake Consensus Mechanism.
- An Epoch lasts One Week.
- The Block Time Target is Three Seconds.
- A Slot is a three seconds period when new Blocks are created.
- Slots are allocated pro rata with Stake every Epoch and removed after Slot Selection.
- A Slot Miss occurs when a validator does not create a new Block or creates a malicious Block when selected.
- Slot Selection determines the Validator of the next Block at any time:-
    - Get Addresses with Slot Allocations.
    - Check Slot Misses from the last Block to the current time.
    - If no Slot Miss, the nearest Address XOR to the last Block hash is selected.
    - If Slot Misses, the nearest Address XOR to the Linear-feedback shift register, shifted to the number of Slot Misses, of the last Block hash is selected.
- The Base Solar Limit is 1,000,000.
- The Base Block Reward is 1 Astre.


### Solar Stability Mechanism
- The Solar price is fixed for every Block.
- The Solar price varies by 0.01%.
- The Solar price increases when more than 90%, and decreases when less than 10%, of the previous Solar Limit was used.
- The Base Solar Price is set at 1 Exaquark / 0.000001 Astre.
